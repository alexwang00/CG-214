    <h2>DOM KENNEDY</h2>
    
</div>
  
    <p> Dom Kennedy is a 32 year-old hip-hop artist from Leimert Park, a section of <br>Los Angeles, California. He has released eight mixtapes and three albums<br> dating back to 2008. In the hip-hop world and especially in California, Dom is <br>known for his smooth flow and laid-back style that he consistently brings to <br>every track he raps on. While some songs have gained mainstream recognition, <br>Dom has remained relatively off the radar to those who don't follow hip-hop. <br>He has always remained an independent artist and even started his own<br> label called OPM (Other People's Money) to which he has signed several <br>artists. His most popular mixtapes among fans are 25th Hours, From the <br>Westside with Love, and Yellow Album. In the past, he has collaborated with<br> artists like Kendrick Lamar, Casey Veggies, Schoolboy Q, and Rick Ross. </p>
