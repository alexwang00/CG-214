    <h1><b>About Me</b></h1>
    
        <p>
        I'm a third-semester student at FIT studing photography. I'm from the Bay Area in California. The only experience I've had with coding is when I completed the free HTML course on Codeacademy a few summers ago. I've always been somewhat interested in computer languages because it can open up many new opportunities and is definitely a very valuable skill.

        To practice coding, we are using a program called <a href= "http://brackets.io/" target= "_blank">Brackets</a>.

        One extension I think will be very helpful is Beautify. It will be very useful in formatting my code to look cleaner and more organized.
