      This is my third semester at FIT studying 
        <br/>photography. Before attending FIT, I studied 
        <br/>Economics and Mathematics at UC Santa Barbara.
        <br/>I grew up in the Bay Area in California. 
        <br/>My passion has always been in sports -- mainly 
        <br/>basketball. But, over the past few years, I 
        <br/>got more serious about photography and now 
        <br/>I'm here. I shoot a lot of portraits - both 
        <br/>composed and street - and concerts whenever 
        <br/>I can get access. You can see my work <a href="www.wangsw0rld.com" target="_blank">here</a>.

        If you don't know where Santa Barbara is, here's a map.
