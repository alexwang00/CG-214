    <h1>Midterm Proposal</h1>
    
    <p>For my midterm, I want to make a website showcasing concert photos I've taken over the past few years. <br> The photos will include portraits and in-concert action shots of different hip-hop artists. <br> The website will consist of three pages: 
    <ul>
        <li>a home page with all the photos</li>
        <li>a page with embedded songs and music videos from the respective artists</li>
        <li>a page with brief bios and one photo of each hip-hop artist featured on the home page</li>
    </ul>
    
    </p>
    
    <p> As a photography major, I'd like to present my concert photos I've shot throughout the last <br> couple years. I already have a portfolio website featuring all of my work but I want to create a <br> website that focuses only on my music photography. Music and concert photography are appealing <br> to me because of the energy I get to capture during the shows. Also, rappers are one of my favorite <br> subjects to shoot because they are usually styled more lavishly than regular subjects and bring a special <br> kind of energy/vibe into the photo.
